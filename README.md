# Log_Archive_Tool
 I wrote a script archive logs by compressing them and storing them in a new directory

### Steps To Run
- Download the shell script code.
- Then, run the script using following command.
- **Remember :** Pass the log directory as an argument in the command line. And this script compress and store **.log** files only.
```bash
./log_archive.sh /var/log
```
- Here, /var/log is the log directory. 
- This command will store the archive file in the same directory where you run the script. The archive file will be stored with timestamp.
